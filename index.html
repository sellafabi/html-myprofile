    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p style="text-align: centerleft;">Hi, I'm Rosella, a 26-year-old aspiring web developer with a passion for learning and creating. While I'm new to the field, I'm eager to gain hands-on experience and collaborate with clients to build innovative websites and applications. My goal is to become a skilled web developer by working closely with clients to understand their unique needs. I'm a great listener and communicator, and I'm committed to building strong relationships based on trust and collaboration.</p>

    <p style="text-align: centerleft;">My background in sales and customer service at Jollibee has taught me the importance of understanding client needs, delivering excellent service, and working efficiently under pressure. I'm excited to bring those skills to the world of web development, creating user-friendly websites and applications that exceed expectations.</p>
        
    <p style="text-align: centerleft;">I've taken the initiative to learn web development through self-study, gaining a foundation in programming.Being a high school graduate alone did not hinder me from pursuing my dreams and achieving success in other ways. There are many paths to a fulfilling life, and a traditional college education is not the only option.</p>
